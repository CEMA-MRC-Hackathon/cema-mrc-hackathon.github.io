- What brought us here is behind us - let‚Äôs try to focus on what we can do this week.

- So let's start by taking a moment to pause, breath and shift our focus to the space we are sharing this week.  

- Most importantly, this week is an opportunity to connect, share knowledge, and build useful tools and relationships from this hackathon.

## What is a hackathon? {.smaller}

Meeting of individuals with diverse interests and skill sets, working in groups to build 
new software tools and solutions.

- Step 1: Sharing ideas for questions to answer by building new software tools
- Step 2: Sharing research skills and interests in the ideas shared 
- Step 3: Identifying the top ideas and software to work on
- Step 4: Formation of groups to work on each identified project
