## Further Updates   {.smaller}

- Please, please, please all respond to Waithera's email for dinner updates
- Think Big. 
  - On Friday, we will have time for groups to plan how to take this work forward:
    - Conference Abstracts?
    - Journal Submission?
    - Grant Applications?
  - However, there is no reason to not also think about the above now:
    - Could someone in your group be spending time writing up your work as a short paper?
    - Is there a conference you have in mind already? Maybe start writing an abstract?
