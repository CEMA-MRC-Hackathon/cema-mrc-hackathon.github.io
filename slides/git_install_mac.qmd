## Introduction {.smaller}

Welcome to the guide for setting up Git and GitHub on Mac. This guide assumes no prior coding or Git experience.

We will cover:

- Downloading and installing Git.
- Verifying the installation.
- Generating an SSH key.
- Adding the SSH key to GitHub.
- Linking the SSH key with RStudio.

---

## Step 1: Install Git {.smaller}

1. Open the **Terminal** application on your Mac.
2. Check if Git is already installed by running:
   ```
   git --version
   ```
3. If Git is not installed, you will see a prompt to install the Xcode Command Line Tools:
   - Click **Install** and follow the on-screen instructions.
4. Once installed, verify Git by running:
   ```
   git --version
   ```
   - You should see a version number, e.g., `git version 2.x.x`.

## Step 2: Generate an SSH Key {.smaller}

1. Open the **Terminal** application.
2. Run the following command:
   ```
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```
   - Replace `your_email@example.com` with your GitHub email address.
3. When prompted:
   - Press Enter to save the key to the default location.
   - (Optional) Enter a passphrase for added security.
4. Your SSH key will be saved to a default location, e.g., `/Users/YourName/.ssh/id_ed25519`.

---

## Step 3: Add the SSH Key to GitHub {.smaller}

1. Display your public SSH key:
   - Run the following command in **Terminal**:
     ```
     cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
     ```
   - Copy the output (Cmd + C).
2. Log in to your GitHub account.
3. Go to **Settings** > **SSH and GPG keys**.
4. Click **New SSH key**:
   - Title: Give your key a name (e.g., "My Mac").
   - Key: Paste the copied key into the text box.
5. Click **Add SSH key**.
6. Confirm your password if prompted.

## Step 4: Test the SSH Connection {.smaller}

1. Open the **Terminal** application.
2. Run the following command:
   ```
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```
3. If successful, you will see a message like:
   ```
   Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
   ```
   - If thereâ€™s an error, check that the SSH key was added correctly.

---

## Step 5: Link SSH Key with RStudio {.smaller}

1. Open RStudio.
2. Go to **Tools** > **Global Options**.
3. In the left-hand menu, click on **Git/SVN**.
4. Check the box labeled **Enable version control interface for RStudio**.
5. Under the **Git executable** field, ensure the path points to the Git installation, e.g., `/usr/bin/git`.
6. Click **Apply** and then **OK**.

---

## Step 6: Configure SSH Key in RStudio {.smaller}

1. Open the **Terminal** tab in RStudio (found at the bottom-right of the screen).
2. Verify the SSH key is correctly set up by running:
   ```
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```
3. If successful, proceed to the next step.

---

## Step 7: Clone a Repository in RStudio {.smaller}

1. Go to your GitHub repository.
2. Click the green **Code** button and select **SSH**.
3. Copy the SSH link (e.g., `git@github.com:username/repo.git`).
4. In RStudio, go to **File** > **New Project** > **Version Control** > **Git**.
5. Paste the SSH link into the **Repository URL** field.
6. Choose a directory to save the project and click **Create Project**.
