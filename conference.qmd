# From Hackathon to Impact

Our hackathon is designed not only to address immediate public health challenges but also to inspire long-term innovation and collaboration. We hope that the groups formed during the event will continue their work, potentially refining their projects into impactful tools or ideas. One way to showcase your work further is by submitting to relevant conferences, sharing insights with the broader scientific and public health community.

To help, weâ€™ve gathered a list of potential conferences where you could present your work. Explore the map below to see the locations of these conferences and learn more about them.

## Conferences Map

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
library(readr)

# Load the data
conferences <- read_csv("data/conferences.csv")
conferences <- conferences[!is.na(conferences$longitude),]

# Create the map
map <- leaflet(conferences) %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(
    ~longitude, ~latitude, 
    popup = ~paste0("<b>", conference, "</b><br>",
                    "Dates: ", dates, "<br>",
                    "Location: ", paste(city, country), "<br>",
                    "Abstract Deadline: ", abstract_deadline,  "<br>",
                    "<a href='", website, "' target='_blank'>Conference Website</a>")
  )

## Submit Your Work

We encourage all teams to consider how their hackathon projects can have a lasting impact. Beyond presenting at conferences, think about collaborating with new partners, publishing in journals, or applying for funding to take your ideas further.

Stay tuned for more updates, and let us know if you have questions about submitting your work or applying for funding opportunities.

## Thinking about other conferences?

If there are other meetings or conferences you are interested in, please let us know. And you can use your newly learnt Github skills to make a pull request to the `data/conferences.csv` to share it.
