Yusuf Ajack is a distinguished researcher with a focus on public health and immunization strategies in Kenya. His work has significantly contributed to understanding the dynamics of vaccination coverage and the impact of socio-political factors on public health initiatives.

Ajack's affiliation with the Ministry of Health in Nairobi from 2015 to 2016 provided him with valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities within the Kenyan healthcare system. His research has addressed critical issues such as the effects of religious and community influences on vaccination uptake, as evidenced by his study on the boycott called by Catholic bishops in 2015, which examined its impact on polio vaccination coverage in Kenya.

In addition to his work on polio, Ajack has also investigated the implications of infectious disease outbreaks, notably documenting the rubella outbreak in a rural Kenyan district in 2014. His findings underscored the urgent need for routine rubella immunization, highlighting the importance of proactive health measures in preventing disease spread.

Through his publications in reputable journals such as the Pan African Medical Journal and BMC Infectious Diseases, Ajack continues to advocate for improved public health policies and practices, aiming to enhance vaccination coverage and overall health outcomes in Kenya.
