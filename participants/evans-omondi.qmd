Evans Omondi is a mathematician and Post-Doctoral Research Scientist (Mathematical modeler) at the African Population and Health Research Center (APHRC) in Kenya. I have a broad background in the application of mathematical modeling applied to biology, with particular expertise in dynamical systems and stochastic processes for modeling infectious diseases.
