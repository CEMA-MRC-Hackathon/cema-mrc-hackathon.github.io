I am a PhD student in Statistics at the Pan African University Institute for Basic Sciences, Technology, and Innovation, which is hosted by Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology in Kenya. My PhD research focuses on Bayesian estimate of a latent traits model defined by a rank-based likelihood, which is in line with the hackathon's objective of creating data-driven tools for evidence-based public health decision-making in Kenya and other resource-constrained situations.
