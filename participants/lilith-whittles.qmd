Lilith Whittles is a researcher at Imperial College London, studying the transmission of infectious diseases through human populations. Her work spans a broad spectrum: from epidemic response to mpox, COVID-19 and group A streptococcus in the UK and Europe, to reducing the impact of globally endemic sexually transmitted infections such as gonorrhoea, HIV and HSV-2.
