    "text": "The “Bridging the Gap Hackathon” is a 5-day event to bring together public health decision-makers, developers, technical experts, and academics and researchers to create free, open-source resources to support and facilitate evidence-informed decision making and address infectious disease policy needs in Kenya.\n\nBackground\nExperiences during the COVID-19 pandemic, which highlighted the challenges decision makers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) face in interpreting and using epidemic forecasts for public health policy. To respond to these challenges, researchers at the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis (MRC-GIDA) at Imperial College London and the Center for Epidemiological Modelling and Analysis (CEMA) at the University of Nairobi are currently conducting a resarch study to explore how the gap between scientific forecasts and practical decision-making, especially in resource-constrained settings can be bridged. This includes an ongoing survey, which is currently open and invites participants who were involved in the COVID-19 response in low- and middle-income countries to share their experiences to help identify the unmet needs related to epidemic forecasting.\n\n\nWho Should Attend\nThe hackathon aims to include a diverse audience, who will either contribute to idea generation or developing the identified software tools. The latter activity will include core training on collaborative coding best practices, which will be strengthened by the delivery of pre-hackathon virtual training courses and teaching material for enrolled participants.\n\nPublic Health Decision-Makers: Ministry of Health officials and public health specialists who provide insights based on real-world public health needs and ensure developed tools address practical challenges.\nDevelopers and Technical Experts: Individuals proficient in R programming, version control using Git and GitHub, epidemiological modelling, and software development.\nAcademics and Researchers: Participants from various Kenyan institutions, not limited to CEMA, who are involved in infectious disease modelling and public health data analysis.\n\nThere is funding to support the attendance of up to 15 local participants and 5 researchers from MRC-GIDA Imperial College.\nRegistration Page\nPlease register your interest for the hackathon using the link above by 22 November 24. We will then be in touch to confirm participant funding, which will be allocated to ensure a diverse range of participants and backgrounds.\n\n\nHackathon Schedule\n\nDay 1: Foundations and Group Formation\n\nIntroductions, icebreaker activities, and team building exercises.\nIdentification of real-world challenges presented by Ministry of Health and Kenyan health data technology company representatives.\nArticulation of skill development goals by researchers.\nFormation of interdisciplinary teams focused on specific public health challenges.\nTraining on Git, Github and collaborative coding practices.\n\nDays 2-3: Coding and Collaboration\n\nDedicated project work time with guidance from experienced facilitators.\nContinuous interaction and feedback sessions to refine ideas and approaches.\n\nDay 4: Presentation and Feedback\n\nTeams present their minimum viable products to Ministry of Health representatives and other stakeholders.\nConstructive feedback and discussions on the relevance and potential impact of the tools developed.\n\nDay 5: Refinement and Next Steps\n\nProject refinement based on the feedback received.\nPlanning for further development, implementation, and potential scaling of the tools.\nClosing remarks and celebration of achievements.\n\n\n\n\nVenue\nThe hackathon will be hosted at the Center for Epidemiological Modelling and Analysis (CEMA):\nCenter for Epidemiological Modelling and Analysis (CEMA) University of Nairobi Institute of Tropical and Infectious Disease (UNITID) Ground Floor, Wing A Faculty of Health Sciences Campus Kenyatta Hospital Compound Off Ngong Road Nairobi Kenya (+254) 20 491 5060\n\n\nSponsors\nWe are extremely grateful to our sponsors for the hackathon:\n\nMRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London (MR/X020258/1) for their support of the hackathon, including supporting researchers from Kenya and the United Kingdom to attend and providing resources for the hackathon.\nWellcome for funding the study inspiring the hackathon (“Leveraging forecasts to optimise decision making” - 228271/Z/23/Z), which supported the original Ideathon team to travel for the hackathon.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
