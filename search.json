His work has significantly contributed to understanding the dynamics of vaccination coverage and the impact of socio-political factors on public health initiatives.\nAjack‚Äôs affiliation with the Ministry of Health in Nairobi from 2015 to 2016 provided him with valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities within the Kenyan healthcare system. His research has addressed critical issues such as the effects of religious and community influences on vaccination uptake, as evidenced by his study on the boycott called by Catholic bishops in 2015, which examined its impact on polio vaccination coverage in Kenya.\nIn addition to his work on polio, Ajack has also investigated the implications of infectious disease outbreaks, notably documenting the rubella outbreak in a rural Kenyan district in 2014. His findings underscored the urgent need for routine rubella immunization, highlighting the importance of proactive health measures in preventing disease spread.\nThrough his publications in reputable journals such as the Pan African Medical Journal and BMC Infectious Diseases, Ajack continues to advocate for improved public health policies and practices, aiming to enhance vaccination coverage and overall health outcomes in Kenya.\n\n\n Back to top"

To respond to these challenges, researchers at the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis (MRC-GIDA) at Imperial College London and the Center for Epidemiological Modelling and Analysis (CEMA) at the University of Nairobi are currently conducting a research study to explore how the gap between quantitative scientists and policymakers, especially in resource-constrained settings can be bridged.\n\n\nWho Should Attend\nThe hackathon aims to include a diverse audience, who will either contribute to idea generation or developing the identified software tools. The latter activity will include core training on collaborative coding best practices, which will be strengthened by the delivery of pre-hackathon virtual training courses and teaching material for enrolled participants.\n\nHealth Decision-Makers & Providers: Ministry of Health officials, health organizations and public health specialists who provide insights based on real-world public health needs and/or ensure developed tools address practical challenges.\nDevelopers and Technical Experts: Individuals proficient in R programming, version control using Git and GitHub, epidemiological modelling, and software development.\nAcademics and Researchers: Participants from various Kenyan institutions, not limited to CEMA, who are involved in infectious disease modelling and public health data analysis.\n\n\n\nHackathon Schedule\n\nDay 1: Foundations and Group Formation\n\nIntroductions, icebreaker activities, and team building exercises.\nSharing of real-world challenges presented by Ministry of Health, health organizations and/or public health specialists.\nFormation of interdisciplinary teams focused on specific public health challenges.\n\nDays 2-3: Coding and Collaboration\n\nOverview of Git, Github and collaborative coding practices (GitHub training should have been completed before attending the course).\nDedicated project work time with guidance from experienced facilitators.\nContinuous interaction and feedback sessions to refine ideas and approaches.\n\nDay 4: Presentation and Feedback\n\nTeams present their minimum viable products to Ministry of Health representatives and other stakeholders.\nConstructive feedback and discussions on the relevance and potential impact of the tools developed.\n\nDay 5: Refinement and Next Steps\n\nProject refinement based on the feedback received.\nPlanning for further development, implementation, and potential scaling of the tools.\nClosing remarks and celebration of achievements.\n\n\n\n\nVenue\nThe hackathon will be hosted by the Center for Epidemiological Modelling and Analysis (CEMA), and will take place at:\nNairobi Safari Club by Swiss-Belhotel, University Wy, Nairobi, Kenya Google Maps\n\n\nSponsors\nWe are extremely grateful to our sponsors for the hackathon:\n\nMRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London (MR/X020258/1) for their support of the hackathon, including supporting researchers from Kenya and the United Kingdom to attend and providing resources for the hackathon.\nWellcome for funding the study inspiring the hackathon (‚ÄúLeveraging forecasts to optimise decision making‚Äù - 228271/Z/23/Z), which supported the original Ideathon team to travel for the hackathon.\nThe Gates Foundation (INV-044079) for supporting involvement of CEMA staff in the hackathon. ### Sponsors\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
